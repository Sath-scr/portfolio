      <p>
       I am a passionate Graphic Designer with a creative mindset and an eye for detail. I specialize in crafting visually appealing designs that communicate ideas effectively and leave a lasting impression.

With a strong foundation in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and CapCut, I create everything from stunning digital illustrations and branding assets to engaging social media content and video edits. My work reflects a balance between creativity and functionality, helping brands connect with their audience in a unique way.

I enjoy turning concepts into compelling visuals and continuously explore new design trends and tools to improve my craft.
